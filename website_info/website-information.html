                    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>Heavy Iron Modding is a medium-large community hosted in a Discord server with the same name. It was established
                        in May of 2018, and was fairly small but has only grown larger since.

                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <h2>Where did we start?</h2>
                    <p>Heavy Iron Modding was formerly known as "BFBB Modding", and started out in a SubReddit titled "r/modthecrapoutofbfbb"
                        on August 18th, 2015 and was a small community known for modding the 2003 hit videogame developed by Heavy Iron Studios
                        titled "SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom". Modding was only possible with QuickBMS and hex editing at the time. A breakthrough
                        in BFBB modding occured in late 2018 when Discord user Igorseabra4 developed "HipHopTool" in C# capable of extracting Assets from 
                        HIP/HOP archives and replacing them without file size limits. Soon after he developed a 3-D level editor called "Industrial Park" that
                        to this day is the level editor of choice for BFBB, TSSM, and many more HIP/HOP games. in June of 2022, Seil and half-owner Penney Marie of a separate Heavy Iron Modding community
                        merged into one Dsicord community to mod/cover all of Heavy Iron Studios' games from Scooby NO1F, to Family Guy: BTTM.
